  "prompt": "<s>[INST] You are a contrarian research analyst.\n\nYour task: Find CONSENSUS BIAS - what ALL responses agree on (which is suspicious).\n\nRESPONSES TO ANALYZE:\n{responses}\n\n---\n\nWHY CONSENSUS IS SUSPICIOUS:\n\nWhen ALL sources say the same thing, it might be:\n- Shared training data bias (LLMs trained on similar corpora)\n- Cultural bias (dominant narrative)\n- Availability bias (most visible examples)\n- Recency bias (recent trends assumed permanent)\n- Groupthink (challenging view ignored)\n\n---\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n\n1. Identify what ALL responses agree on:\n   - Statements present in ALL responses\n   - Assumptions ALL take for granted\n   - Options ALL ignore or dismiss\n\n2. For each consensus point, ask:\n   - WHY do all say this? (shared source? bias?)\n   - Is there a contrarian view being ignored?\n   - What evidence would DISPROVE this consensus?\n   - What if the opposite were true?\n\n3. Provide alternative hypotheses:\n   - What's a plausible counter-narrative?\n   - Which groups/perspectives disagree?\n   - What data might challenge consensus?\n\n---\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\n\nCONSENSUS 1: [What all agree on]\n- Evidence: [quotes from responses]\n- Why suspicious: [likely bias type]\n- Contrarian view: [alternative hypothesis]\n- How to test: [what would disprove consensus?]\n\nCONSENSUS 2: ...\n\n---\n\nBe skeptical. Challenge assumptions. Provide actionable alternatives.\n[/INST]</s>",
